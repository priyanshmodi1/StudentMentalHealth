    "According to Kaggle, the student mental health dataset was collected by a survey conducted in 2020 by Google forms from University students in order to examine their current academic situation and mental health. The motivation behind analyzing this dataset is to see how prevalent mental health issues are for university students and how this relates to various variables including but not limited to their gender, age, year in school, cGPA, and marital status. As a college student, this is a relatable topic and would be informative to see if there are any strong correlations between these variables."

In addition, the data only hold 100 observations, which is a pretty small sample size. This causes us to have certain conditions like independence is not quite met for our analysis as we will see later in the sections. Our data contains information of 100 university students with their age, gender, course of study (major), year in university, cGPA, and whether or not they have depression, anxiety, panic attack, and if they receive treatment from a specialist. Not included in the data that I would want to add are their socioeconomic standing, family history, their location, and size of the university that they attend."

    "Based on the histogram that visualizes the percentage of university students with or without depression based on gender, we can see that females have a higher percentage with depression of about 38.7 percenage compared to males with depression of about 24 percent. Next, we compared the distribution of ages based on gender and whether one has depression using the violinplots and the median age summary statistics for each of the four groups, we found that of the people who are depressed, the median ages are slightly greater for women compared to men with values 19 and 18.5 respectively. This difference is not much however. The spread for females is much greater when looking at Q1-Q3 so it's hard to compare the two. One noticeable difference is that males without depression have a median age of 21 which is greater compared to those with depression and females without depression. Females seem to not differ much in age distribution whether they have depression or not. However, for males, it seems that those who have depression are younger than those who reported to not have depression."

    "We want a high tpr (true positive rate) close to 1 and a low fpr (false positive rate) close to zero. From the graph, this is around where tpr is close to 0.7 and fpr is close to 0.4. This corresponds to a threshold of around 0.35 where tpr is 0.714286 and fpr is 0.384615. I chose this given my research goals of identifying students at risk of depression. We don't want our tpr as high as we can without having an extreme fpr so I chose the point where tpr is close to 0.7 and fpr is close to 0.4 rather than the point where tpr is close to 0.57 and the false positive rate is close to 0.15 because it is more important to correctly identity depressed students than to falsely identify a student as depressed."

    "Future Work: If I was to conduct future work based on these analyses, I would gather a greater sample size, noting which universities these students come from in order to ensure an independent random sample. I would also add more insightful questions to the survey such as someone's socioeconomic background, family history of mental illness, history of chilhood abuse/trauma, and their race or ethnicity. Since these are known factors that affect mental illness, we can see if there is a trend amongst university students. Another thing to note is that the survey from this dataset was taken in 2020, as noted in the timestamps. This is during the beginning or the COVID pandemic when the lockdown was prevalent and enforced; therefore, this could have influenced the mental health issues in students due to the isolation. It would be interesting to compare a new survey with this survey to see if there are any differences."
